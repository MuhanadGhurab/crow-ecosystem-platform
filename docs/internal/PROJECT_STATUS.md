# Project status

**Last updated:** 25 May 2026 (F12 product demo & external readiness)  
**Audience:** Internal delivery / engineering

**Checkpoint detail:** [`RC1_STAGING_VALIDATION.md`](RC1_STAGING_VALIDATION.md) · **Milestone map:** [`MILESTONES.md`](MILESTONES.md)

## Current milestone

**RC1 — passed.**

Staging deployment on Vercel with Supabase pooler + Auth is **validated**: login, CEM Command Center, admin surfaces, MEEM tenant runtime, blueprint/go-live paths, CyberCrow advisory views, notifications, and controlled client portal preview.

RC1 is **advisory-first** — no hard billing enforcement, no usage blocking, no SCIM/Entra group sync.

## Current delivery track

**Phase F12 — product demo, showcase & external readiness** (25 May 2026).

Demo storyboard, route index, screenshot checklist, and operator playbook for repeatable 5–10 minute walkthroughs. Public docs and root README polished for portfolio/CV (sanitized, no secrets, no internal IDs). Detail: [`F12_DEMO_STORYBOARD.md`](F12_DEMO_STORYBOARD.md) · [`F12_DEMO_ROUTE_INDEX.md`](F12_DEMO_ROUTE_INDEX.md) · [`F12_SCREENSHOT_CHECKLIST.md`](F12_SCREENSHOT_CHECKLIST.md) · [`F12_OPERATOR_DEMO_PLAYBOOK.md`](F12_OPERATOR_DEMO_PLAYBOOK.md).

**F12 acceptance:** **PASSED** (docs + validation gate) — no product features, schema, or enforcement scope added.

**Completed prior:** **F11** organic browser E2E — [`F11_ORGANIC_BROWSER_E2E_SIGNOFF.md`](F11_ORGANIC_BROWSER_E2E_SIGNOFF.md) · F10 — [`F10_TENANT_ONBOARDING_OPERATOR_CONSOLE.md`](F10_TENANT_ONBOARDING_OPERATOR_CONSOLE.md) · F9 · F8 · F7 · F6 Rimal.

**Demo scripts:** `npm run meem:ids:staging` · `npm run tenant:verify:rimal` · `npm run request:pipeline:verify` · `npm run onboarding:verify` · `npm run public:mirror-manifest`.

RC1 remains the staging health baseline; F7 does not replace production-readiness planning.

## Recommended Phase F options (not selected)

Pick **one primary track** after planning; others can run in parallel only if resourced.

| # | Option | Summary |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Production readiness** | Azure or Vercel prod, domain, Entra prod redirects, migrate deploy in release, health smoke |
| 2 | **Public portfolio polish** | README/screenshots, sanitized public docs, contributor onboarding |
| 3 | **Tenant onboarding hardening** | **F6** Rimal · **F7** pipeline · **F8** five-sector templates + organic E2E |
| 4 | **Package UX** | Startup / Growth / Enterprise surfaces — still advisory unless billing chosen |
| 5 | **Security hardening** | Rate limiting, Turnstile on public request API, extended audit |
| 6 | **Stripe live alignment** | Live checkout, webhook reconciliation, enforcement policy decision |
| 7 | **Entra / SCIM planning** | Group sync and provisioning design only — no implementation commitment |

---

## Honest backlog context (M1–M8)

Long-running milestone percentages remain in [`MILESTONES.md`](MILESTONES.md). RC1 does not mark M7/M8 as 100%; it confirms **staging health** for the integrated platform slice.

| Area | Note |
|------|------|
| M2 MEEM E2E | Lighthouse pipeline live on staging; customer SAREA acceptance (M5) still separate |
| M7 Cloud | Staging on Vercel validated; Azure primary path still open |
| M8 SaaS | Stripe scaffold; live charges not RC1 scope |

---

## What not to do immediately after RC1

- No new features without Phase F plan
- No schema changes without migration review
- No auth routing churn without security review
- No secrets or `.env` content in git or public docs
